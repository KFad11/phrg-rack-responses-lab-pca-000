# Rack Responses Lab

Let's create a quick time appropriate greeter application

## Instructions

Create your application with the following conditions: 

  1. If it's before noon, greet the user with "Good Morning!"
  2. If it's after noon, greet the user with "Good Afternoon!". Remember that getting the time may return results in 24 hour time! Anytime after 12 is the afternoon.
